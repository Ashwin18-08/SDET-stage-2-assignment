# 🛠️ Java Development Assignments

This repository contains two structured Java-based assignments demonstrating **Maven** and **Spring Framework**.

---

## 📦 Maven Assignment

This section highlights the use of Apache Maven for project management and build automation.

### ✅ Features Implemented

- **JAR Packaging**  
  Configured Maven to package the project as a `.jar` file using the `packaging` tag.

- **Profiles Creation**  
  Defined multiple build profiles to support different environments (e.g., dev, test, prod).

- **Site Generation**  
  Used `mvn site` to generate project documentation and reports.

- **Inheritance Implementation**  
  Demonstrated Maven inheritance using parent and child `pom.xml` files.

- **Skipping Test Phase**  
  Applied the `-DskipTests` flag to bypass test execution during the `install` phase.

- **Plugin Integration**  
  Added and configured essential Maven plugins for compilation, testing, and reporting.

## 🌱 Spring Assignment

This section explores various configuration styles in the Spring Framework.

### ✅ Configuration Styles Demonstrated

- **XML-Based Configuration**  
  Defined beans and dependencies using traditional `applicationContext.xml`.

- **Annotation-Based Configuration**  
  Utilized `@Component`, `@Autowired`, and other annotations for component scanning and dependency injection.

- **Java-Based Configuration**  
  Implemented `@Configuration` and `@Bean` annotations to define beans programmatically.
